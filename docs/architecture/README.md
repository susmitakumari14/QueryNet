## 🎯 Architecture Overview

QueryNet follows a modern microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Frontend (React) ←→ API Gateway ←→ Backend Services ←→ Database (MongoDB)
                              ↓
                         External Services
                    (Auth, Cache, Notifications)
```

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data layers
2. **Scalability** - Horizontally scalable components with stateless design
3. **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection at every layer
4. **Performance** - Caching, optimization, and efficient data access patterns
5. **Maintainability** - Clean code, documentation, and testing strategies

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Tier**
- React 19.1 + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- React Router for navigation

**Backend Tier**
- Node.js + Express.js
- TypeScript for type safety
- JWT for authentication
- Redis for caching

**Data Tier**
- MongoDB for primary data
- Redis for sessions/cache
- File storage for uploads

**Infrastructure**
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Railway for backend hosting

## 🔍 How to Read the Diagrams

Each architecture diagram uses Mermaid syntax and includes:

- **Components**: Boxes representing services, applications, or data stores
- **Connections**: Arrows showing data flow and communication
- **Groupings**: Related components grouped by function or layer
- **Icons**: Visual indicators for different types of components

## 📊 Architecture Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Frontend**: < 2s initial load time
- **API Response**: < 200ms average response time
- **Database**: < 100ms query execution time
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target

### Scalability Metrics
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+ supported
- **Questions per Day**: 100,000+ capacity
- **Storage**: Petabyte-scale document storage
- **API Calls**: 1M+ requests per day

### Security Standards

- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Compliance**: GDPR and SOC 2 compliant

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

When making significant architectural changes:

1. **Document the Decision** - Create an ADR explaining the choice
2. **Consider Alternatives** - Evaluate multiple solutions
3. **Impact Assessment** - Analyze effects on existing systems
4. **Migration Strategy** - Plan implementation approach
